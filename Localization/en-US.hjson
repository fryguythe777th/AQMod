				8: Testing... testing... Everything seems to be in order.
				9: Get away from there, {0}! I'm expecting an important message from {1}!

					3: Sometimes I look into the sky and see another solar system... but it must be a mirage from the amount of light reflecting off the surface of the planet, even if I cannot prove that it is a mirage.
